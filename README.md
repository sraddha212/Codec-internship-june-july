## Project 1: Handwritten Digit Recognizer (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to recognize handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**.

### ✨ Features:
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on 28x28 grayscale images (digits 0–9)
- Achieves ~98% accuracy on test data
- Visualizes predictions alongside actual labels
- Saves the trained model (`.h5` format)

### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

### 📁 File:
- `digit.py`

## Project 2: Real-Time Speech-to-Text

A lightweight speech recognition script that captures real-time voice input from a microphone and converts it into text using Google’s Speech Recognition API.

### ✨ Features:
- Real-time microphone input
- Live transcription displayed in console
- Handles unknown speech or silence gracefully

### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Python
- SpeechRecognition
- PyAudio

### 📁 File:
- `speechtotext.py`
